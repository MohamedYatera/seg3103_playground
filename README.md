Open wsl using CMD or  Powershell

Navigate to (newmath_java or newmath_ex or newmath_ex) and run : 
   ./bin/run

**Lab 2**

I used WSL to run the test through ./bin/test

DateTest.java: Simple JUnit test where i assert (Expected, actual), Should pass test if they are the same. I included the 
Ones that failed. I am aware that they do not pass the test, but i wasnt sure if i was supposed to take them out or not,
we know they are going to fail the test case since it doesnt pass the valid equivalence classes

DateNextDateOkTest.java: Same thing as DateTest.java expect this test is paramaterized meaning i dont write a test case for every single
test case, i write one "test case code" and the test case values will be passed through one by one.

DateNextDateExceptionTest.java: Supposed to be the same as the one right above ^ expect its for the ones throwing 
an Illegal argument exception (Lower half of given table)
